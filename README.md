# Neural Network 
This project focuses on implementing a neural network using Python and associated libraries. It involves designing, training, and testing the neural network on a given dataset to analyze its performance and effectiveness. The project also provides insights into machine learning model evaluation and deployment strategies.

## Getting Started


These guidelines will assist you in setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing. Refer to the deployment section for details on running the project in a production setting.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software and how to install them:

Anaconda



This project focuses on creating a neural network using Python and its associated libraries. It involves the design, training, and testing of the network on a given dataset to assess its efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, the project examines methods for evaluating machine learning models and strategies for their deployment.

To install the necessary dependencies, execute the following command:

pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn



### Installing

https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/docs/problem_solving/01-Orientation/01.03-Installing-Anaconda-on-Windows.html

End the setup process by confirming that all tests pass successfully.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end-to-end tests

These tests ensure the entire workflow is functioning correctly, covering data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

To run the tests, use the following command:

python test_script.py

This script verifies:

Proper data loading and preprocessing.
Initialization and training of the model.
Evaluation process and metric computation.

### And coding style tests

These tests ensure adherence to Python coding standards and conventions.

flake8 <project_directory>


This command checks for PEP 8 compliance and suggests fixes for coding style issues.

## Deployment

To deploy the model on a live system:

1. Train the model and save it:
python train.py --save_model


2. Use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI to serve the model:
python app.py


3. Access the model's API endpoint via the browser or HTTP clients like Postman.
